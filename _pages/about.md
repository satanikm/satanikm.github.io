Welcome to my personal website !   
I like to introduce myself as a mechanical engineer doing research on the most complex machine - the human body! To be more specific, I am a final year Doctoral Researcher in the Univerisity of Leuven, Belgium under the supervision of Prof. Liesbet Geris. My PhD thesis is focussed on developing multiscale computational models to study the effects of mechanical loading in the degeneration and regeneration of articular cartilage. 

My research interests
--------
I am fascinated by how mechanics influences various processes in the human body, both in a positive and negative manner. This has led to my present reseach interests in the field of mechanobiology, which is to study how mechanical signals affect biological processes in the body. My doctoral research zooms in to mechanobiology of articular cartilage, which is a soft cushioning tissue that facilitates  

My Background
--------
Prior to my PhD, I had completed Masters in Applied Mechanics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. 

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
