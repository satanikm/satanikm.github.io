Welcome to my personal website!

I am a mechanical engineer with a passion for understanding the most complex machine ever built — the human body. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Guilak Lab at Washington University in St. Louis, where I am developing innovative approaches combining mchanobiology and synthetic biology to promote regeneration of articular cartilage.

I earned my PhD in April 2025 from the University of Leuven (KU Leuven), Belgium, under the supervision of Prof. Liesbet Geris. My doctoral research focused on developing multiscale computational models to investigate how mechanical loading influences the degeneration and regeneration of articular cartilage.

My work bridges engineering, biology, and medicine — with the ultimate goal of contributing to innovative therapies for joint diseases like osteoarthritis.

My research interests
--------
I am fascinated by how mechanics influences various processes in the human body, both in a positive and negative manner. This has led to my strong interest in the field of mechanobiology, which is to study how mechanical signals affect biological processes in the body. I like to follow a highly interdisciplinary and integrative approach to study mechanically induced physiopathological processes in human body and devise novel therapeutic strategies for the same. To do so, I use a complementary set of in silico and in vitro tools encompassing multiple length scales. In silico approaches involve physics based models, image processing, computational biology. To facilitate my interdisciplinary research, I actively collaborate with international academic partners, clinical partners, industry as well as patient organisations.

My Background
--------
Prior to my PhD, I had completed Masters in Applied Mechanics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. 

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
