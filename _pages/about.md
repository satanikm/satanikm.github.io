I'm a mechanical engineer passionate about understanding the most complex machine ever built â€” the human body !

Currently, I'm a **postdoctoral researcher** in the **Guilak Lab** at **Washington University in St. Louis**, where I develop approaches combining mechanobiology and synthetic biology to promote articular cartilage regeneration. Prior to this, I earned my PhD in 2025 from **KU Leuven**, Belgium, under **Prof. Liesbet Geris**, focusing on multiscale computational modeling of cartilage degeneration and regeneration.

My work bridges engineering, biology and medicine, with the goal of advancing therapies for joint diseases like osteoarthritis.


## ðŸ”¬ Research Interests

I'm fascinated by how mechanical forces shape biological processes â€” in both health and disease. The overall objective of my research is to investigate how mechanical and biochemical factors interact in the initiation and progression of osteoarthritis. In parallel, I aim to develop smart, mechano-responsive cell-based systems that can sense mechanical cues within the joint environment and deliver targeted therapeutic responses â€” offering a novel approach to precision medicine for osteoarthritis.

My research integrates:

- **Mechanobiology**: How mechanical signals influence cells and tissues
- **Synthetic biology**: Mechanogenetic gene circuits that turn mechanical cues into therapeutic responses

Using a combination of:  
- **In silico tools**: Physics-based modeling, image analysis, computational biology  
- **In vitro models**: Bioreactors, cartilage-on-chip systems   

I actively collaborate with academic researchers, clinicians, industry, and patient organizations to ensure my work is **translational** and **impact-driven**.
