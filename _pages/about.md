Welcome to my personal website!

I am a mechanical engineer with a passion for understanding the most complex machine ever built — the human body. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Guilak Lab at Washington University in St. Louis, where I am developing innovative approaches combining mechanobiology and synthetic biology to promote regeneration of articular cartilage.

I earned my PhD in April 2025 from the University of Leuven (KU Leuven), Belgium, under the supervision of Prof. Liesbet Geris. My doctoral research focused on developing multiscale computational models to investigate how mechanical loading influences the degeneration and regeneration of articular cartilage.

My work bridges engineering, biology, and medicine — with the ultimate goal of contributing to innovative therapies for joint diseases like osteoarthritis.

My research interests
--------
I am deeply fascinated by how mechanical forces influence biological processes in the human body — both in health and disease. This curiosity has driven my strong interest in mechanobiology, the interdisciplinary field that explores how mechanical signals regulate cellular and tissue behavior.

My research focuses on understanding mechanically induced (patho)physiological processes, with the goal of developing novel therapeutic strategies for musculoskeletal disorders. I take an integrative, interdisciplinary approach, combining insights from engineering, biology, and medicine. To study these complex systems, I use a complementary set of in silico and in vitro tools across multiple length scales.

In silico methods include physics-based modeling, image processing, and computational biology to simulate and analyze mechanical-biological interactions.
On the experimental side, I use in vitro models such as bioreactor setups and cartilage-on-chip devices, that provide biologically relevant insights into how tissues respond to mechanical environments. In parallel, I am also exploring tools from synthetic biology, particularly the use of mechanogenetic synthetic gene circuits, to engineer cells that can sense mechanical cues and trigger targeted therapeutic responses. This allows for the development of smart, responsive systems that bridge mechanics with precision medicine.

My work thrives on collaboration — I actively engage with international academic researchers, clinicians, industry partners and patient organizations to ensure that my research remains translational, impactful, and connected to real-world needs.

My Background
--------
Prior to my PhD, I had completed Masters in Applied Mechanics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. 

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
